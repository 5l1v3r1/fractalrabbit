  <p align="center">
    - The FRACTALRABBIT stochastic mobility simulator creates realistic synthetic sporadic waypoint data sets. It consist of three tiers, each based on new stochastic models: </p>
<p>	
	 - (1) An Agoraphobic Point Process generates a set V of space points, whose limit is a random fractal, representing sites that could be visited. </p>
<p>	 - (2) A Retro-preferential Process generates a trajectory X through V , with strategic homing and self-reinforcing site Ô¨Ådelity as observed in human/animal behavior. </p>
<p>	 - (3) A Sporadic Reporting Process models time points T at which the trajectory X is observed, with bursts of reports and heavy tailed inter-event times.</p>
  </p>
